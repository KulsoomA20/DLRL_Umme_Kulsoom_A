## Assignment Overview

This repository documents a set of five independent implementations developed as part of the **Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning (BAI701)** coursework.  
The primary objective of the assignment was to gain practical exposure to fundamental deep learning architectures and reinforcement learning techniques through hands-on implementation and experimentation.

Each implementation is maintained in a separate folder and includes the complete source code along with a concise README describing the methodology and observations.

## Implemented Models and Concepts

The assignment covers a range of learning paradigms, progressing from convolution-based models for image data to sequence learning and reinforcement learning approaches.

### 1. AlexNet
- Implementation of the AlexNet architecture to study deep convolutional neural networks.
- Focuses on layered convolution, pooling, and fully connected structures used in image classification tasks.

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) – Fashion MNIST
- A CNN trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Demonstrates image classification using convolutional layers, activation functions, and pooling operations.

### 3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network
- Implementation of an LSTM model to understand sequence learning.
- Highlights how LSTMs manage long-term dependencies more effectively than traditional RNNs.

### 4. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for Text Generation
- A basic RNN-based text generation model.
- Explores character-level or sequence-based text prediction using recurrent architectures.

### 5. Deep Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)
- Implementation of Q-Learning using a state–action reward matrix.
- Incorporates environment-based decision-making using predefined constraints.
- Demonstrates policy learning, reward optimization, and path selection in a graph-based environment.
